# Chione

Chione is a command-line personal assistant chatbot that keeps track of your tasks.
It is built as the individual project (iP) for CS2103/T.

## Features

| Command                                          | What it does                      |
|--------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------|
| `todo DESCRIPTION`                               | Adds a task with no date          |
| `deadline DESCRIPTION /by WHEN`                  | Adds a task due by a given time   |
| `event DESCRIPTION /from START /to END`          | Adds a task spanning two times    |
| `list`                                           | Shows every task                  |
| `on DATE`                                        | Shows the tasks falling on a day  |
| `find KEYWORD`                                   | Shows the tasks matching a word   |
| `mark INDEX` / `unmark INDEX`                    | Marks a task as done / not done   |
| `delete INDEX`                                   | Removes a task                    |
| `bye`                                            | Ends the conversation             |

### Dates

Write a date as `2019-10-15`, or as `2019-10-15 1800` to include a time of day.
Chione shows it back in a friendlier form, e.g. `Oct 15 2019, 6:00pm`.

`on 2019-10-15` lists everything happening that day: deadlines falling on it, and
events running over it, including ones that started on an earlier day.

### Searching

`find book` shows every task whose description contains that text. The search
ignores case, and matches anywhere in the description rather than whole words
only, so `find oo` finds `read book` too. Only the description is searched — a
deadline is not found by the date it falls on. Use `on` for that.

### Saving

Your tasks are written to `data/chione.txt` after every change and read back when
Chione starts, so the list is still there the next time you run it. The file is
plain text, so you can open and edit it yourself if you ever need to.

Example session:

```
todo borrow book
    ____________________________________________________________
     Got it. I've added this task:
       [T][ ] borrow book
     Now you have 1 tasks in the list.
    ____________________________________________________________
```

## Building and running with Gradle

The wrapper script fetches the right version of Gradle itself, so nothing needs
to be installed beforehand. On Windows use `gradlew` in place of `./gradlew`.

| Command           | What it does                                      |
|-------------------|---------------------------------------------------|
| `./gradlew run`   | Builds Chione and starts it                       |
| `./gradlew build` | Compiles everything and runs the checks and tests |
| `./gradlew test`  | Runs the tests only                               |
| `./gradlew clean` | Deletes everything that was built                 |

Prerequisites: JDK 25. Nothing else — the wrapper downloads Gradle on first use.

## Running the released JAR

`./gradlew shadowJar` produces `build/libs/chione.jar`, a single file carrying
everything Chione needs. To run it:

1. Put the JAR in a folder of its own.
2. Open a command line in that folder.
3. Run it:

   ```
   java -jar chione.jar
   ```

The quotes in `java -jar "chione.jar"` are only needed if the path contains a
space or a character the shell treats specially.

Chione keeps its tasks in `data/chione.txt` **relative to the folder you run it
from**, so the JAR creates that folder beside itself the first time you add a
task. Running it from two different folders gives you two separate task lists.

The JAR is not kept in this repository — it is built from the source, and
published on the [releases page](../../releases).

## Setting up in Intellij

Prerequisites: JDK 25, update Intellij to the most recent version.

1. Open Intellij (if you are not in the welcome screen, click `File` > `Close Project` to close the existing project first)
1. Open the project into Intellij as follows:
   1. Click `Open`.
   1. Select the project directory, and click `OK`.
   1. If there are any further prompts, accept the defaults.
1. Configure the project to use **JDK 25** (not other versions) as explained in [here](https://www.jetbrains.com/help/idea/sdk.html#set-up-jdk).<br>
   In the same dialog, set the **Project language level** field to the `SDK default` option.
1. After that, locate the `src/main/java/chione/Chione.java` file, right-click it, and choose `Run Chione.main()` (if the code editor is showing compile errors, try restarting the IDE). If the setup is correct, you should see the banner above followed by a greeting.

**Warning:** Keep the `src\main\java` folder as the root folder for Java files (i.e., don't rename those folders or move Java files to another folder outside of this folder path), as this is the default location some tools (e.g., Gradle) expect to find Java files.

## Acknowledgements

The code in this project was written with Claude Code (Anthropic), used at
level AI-5: the AI implemented each increment from the requirements given in
the course website, and I reviewed the resulting code, asked for explanations
of the design decisions behind it, and tested the behaviour before committing.
