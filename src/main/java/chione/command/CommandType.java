/**
 * The words Chione understands at the start of a line.
 *
 * <p>Each constant owns the keyword the user types to invoke it, so the list of
 * valid commands exists in exactly one place: adding a command here is enough
 * for {@link chione.Parser Parser} to recognise it and quote it in error messages, and for the
 * compiler to demand a branch for it in the switch that carries commands out.
 *
 * <p>Recognising which keyword was typed is {@link chione.Parser Parser}'s job, not this
 * enum's. What is left here is the vocabulary itself.
 *
 * <p>An enum is used rather than string constants because a {@code CommandType} can
 * only ever hold one of these nine values. A typo like {@code CommandType.LITS}
 * fails to compile, whereas the string {@code "lits"} would compile happily and
 * simply never match anything at runtime.
