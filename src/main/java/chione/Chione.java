/**
 * The Chione chatbot.
 *
 * <p>Chione tracks three kinds of task (todo, deadline and event), and can list,
 * mark, unmark, delete and search them by date. Each line of input is turned by
 * {@link Parser} into a {@link Command}, which then carries itself out; anything
 * that cannot be carried out is reported as a {@link ChioneException} and
 * explained to the user, so the conversation continues until {@code bye}.
 *
 * <p>This class does very little itself. It owns a {@link Ui}, a {@link Storage}
 * and a {@link TaskList}, and hands all three to whichever command it was given.
 * It has no branch per command and no knowledge of what any command does, so a
 * new command can be added without this file changing at all.
 *
 * <p>There are two ways in. {@link #run()} holds a conversation on the console,
 * and {@link #getResponse(String)} answers a single line and hands the reply back
 * to whoever asked — which is how the window talks to Chione. Both go through the
 * same parser, the same commands and the same {@link Ui}, so the two interfaces
 * cannot drift apart in what they say or accept.
