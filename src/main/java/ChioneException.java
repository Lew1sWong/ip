/**

 * words. Anything the user could plausibly type wrongly is reported this way,
 * which keeps the checks next to the code that knows what "wrong" means while
 * the reporting stays in one place.
 *
 * <p>It extends {@link Exception} rather than {@code RuntimeException} so the
 * compiler forces every caller to either handle it or declare it, making it
 * impossible to forget one of these errors by accident.
